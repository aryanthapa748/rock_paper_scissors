# rock_paper_scissors
This repository contains a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in JavaScript. The game allows a player to play against the computer in a series of rounds and displays the winner at the end. I also applied some basic styling and layouts to make it visually attractive. Go ahead and test you luck.. Hope you win the game :) !!
